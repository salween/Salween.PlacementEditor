# `Salween.PlacementEditor`
This is a module that overrides the default content type placement editor.

The purpose of this module is to include tabs into the placement editor which overrides the default content type placement editor that can be found by navigating to _admin dashboard_ > _content definition_ > _edit a part_ > _edit placement_.
Orchard's source code does not handle tabs at all either at the retrieval process or the placement change storage process.
