# Salween.PlacementEditor
This is a module that overrides the default content type placement editor.

The purpose of this module is to include tabs into the placement editor which overrides the default content type placement editor that can be found by navigating to admin dashboard > content definition > edit a part > edit placement.
Orchard's source code does not handle tabs at all either at the retreival process or the placement change stroage process.
